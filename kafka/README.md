This document defines how to describe Kafka-specific information on AsyncAPI.

## Versions

We differentiate bindings versions for AsyncAPI v2.x and AsyncAPI v3.x specification documents as the way to introduce bindings in those different versions of the spec is slightly different.

Current version for AsyncAPI v2.x documents is `v2-0.4.0` and details can found [here](./README-v2.md).

Current version for AsyncAPI v3.x documents is `v3-0.4.0` and details can found [here](./README-v2.md).
